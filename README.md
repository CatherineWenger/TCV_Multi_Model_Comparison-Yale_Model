This study compares the cost-effectiveness of various typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) schedules under different scenarios. A compartmental transmission dynamic model was used to model the epidemiological output for each scenario and strategy. Then, the cost-effectiveness of each strategy was calculated across the different scenarios from the government perspective using the net-monetary benefit framework. This repository contains the code for the Yale model in this multi-model comparison. Repositories for the other models are provided in the supplementary documentation of the manuscript.


### Primary Analysis (10-year time horizon): 
#### Vaccine strategies
1. No vaccination
2. Routine TCV vaccination at 9 months with a catch-up campaign
3. Routine TCV vaccination at 2 years with a catch-up campaign
4. Routine TCV vaccination at 5 years with a catch-up campaign
5. Routine TCV vaccination at 9 months + booster dose at 5 years with a catch-up campaign


#### Scenarios evaluated
1. Incidence setting: medium (10-<100 cases per 100,000 person-years), high (100-<500 cases per 100,000 person-years), very high (>500 cases per 100,000 person-years)
2. Vaccine waning scenario: slow waning (duration of protection ~ 40 years), fast waning (duration of protection ~ 8 years)
3. Cost/outcome impact setting: Africa (high case-fatality ratio/high cost setting), Asia (low case-fatality ratio/low cost setting)
##### This resulted in 12 total scenario combinations in the primary analysis


#### <ins>Secondary Analyses:</ins>
1. 20-year time horizon, including a two-booster vaccine strategy (Routine TCV vaccination at 9 months + booster dose at 5 & 10 years with a catch-up campaign)
2. Primary vaccine strategies without a catch-up campaign
3. Youngest age of vaccination at 15 months instead of 9 months


## File descriptions
### *Transmission_dynamic_model folder* <br>
  > **run_Parallel_1000_slow.R** runs 1000 model simulations for all vaccine strategies and incidence settings, assuming slow-waning conditions. This code runs the vaccine strategies for each incidence setting in parallel to shorten computing time. <br>  
  **run_Parallel_1000_fast.R** runs 1000 model simulations for all vaccine strategies and incidence settings, assuming fast-waning conditions. This code runs the vaccine strategies for each incidence setting in parallel to shorten computing time. <br>  
  **parallelization_slow.R** is called by *run_Parallel_1000_slow.R* and sets up the parameters for running the specified scenario combination and runs 1000 simulations. <br>  
  **parallelization_fast.R** is called by *run_Parallel_1000_fast.R* and sets up the parameters for running the specified scenario combination and runs 1000 simulations.  <br>  
  **typhoid_ode_slow_waning.R** is called by the ODE solver in *parallelization_slow.R* and contains the model's ordinary differential equations for a slow-waning setting, which assumes exponentially distributed vaccine waning. <br>  
  **typhoid_ode_fast_waning.R** is called by the ODE solver in *parallelization_fast.R* and contains the model's ordinary differential equations for a fast-waning setting, which assumes gamma-distributed vaccine waning. <br>  
  **search_grid_slow.Rdata** is called by *run_Parallel_1000_slow.R* and provides the stochastic parameter samples for each simulation. <br>  
  **search_grid_fast.Rdata** is called by *run_Parallel_1000_fast.R* and provides the stochastic parameter samples for each simulation. <br>  
### *Process_TDM_output folder* <br>
  > **Process_Results.Rmd** runs *post_count_doses_by_year.R* and *post_count_cases_by_year.R* for each scenario combination (incidence setting, waning, age of earliest vaccination) to generate output to be used in the cost-effectiveness model.  <br>  
  **post_count_doses_by_year.R** generates yearly counts of doses administered upon vaccine introduction for each simulation. <br>  
  **post_cases_per_year.R** generates yearly counts of cases occurring in total and for each age group following vaccine introduction for each simulation.  <br>  
### *Cost_effectiveness_model folder* <br>
  > **load_data.R** loads all saved output files created after running *Process_Results.Rmd.* <br>  
  **MakeDoses.R** formats simulated doses for all scenario combinations into one array in preparation for the economic calculations. <br>  
  **MakeCases.R** formats simulated cases for all scenario combinations into one array in preparation for the economic calculations. <br>  
  **CEA_Parameters.Rmd** creates an array with all fixed and stochastic parameters used in the economic calculations so that each parameter sample is specific to each scenario combination and simulation. <br>  
  **CEA_Model_Calculations.Rmd** uses the parameter array to calculate each of the economic outcomes of interest (ex: hospitalizations, disability-adjusted life years, deaths, treatment costs, and vaccination costs) for each simulation, scenario combination, and vaccine strategy. <br>
